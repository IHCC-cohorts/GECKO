# Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology

**NOTE:** This is work in progress.

An ontology to represent genomics cohort attributes. The GECKO is maintained by the CINECA project, https://www.cineca-project.eu, and standardises attributes commonly used for genomics cohort description as well as individual-level data items. A series of tools is being developed to enable automated generation of harmonised data files based on a JSON schema mapping file. For more information please contact info@cineca-project.eu
