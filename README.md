# Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology

**NOTE:** This is work in progress.

An ontology to represent genomics cohort attributes. The GECKO is maintained by the CINECA project, https://www.cineca-project.eu, and standardises attributes commonly used for genomics cohort description as well as individual-level data items. A series of tools is being developed to enable automated generation of harmonised data files based on a JSON schema mapping file. For more information please contact info@cineca-project.eu

GECKO currently has two products:
* `gecko.owl`: the OBO version of GECKO
* `views/ihcc-gecko.owl`: a view developed for [International HundredK+ Cohorts Consortium](https://ihccglobal.org/)

While the OBO view of GECKO conforms to OBO priniciples and reuses classes from upper-level ontologies such as [BFO](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl), the IHCC view rearranges the core GECKO terms (including some imported, lower-level terms) and groups them into 5 categories:
